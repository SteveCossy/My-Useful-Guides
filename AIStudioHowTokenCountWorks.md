You've definitely run into a common issue with large conversation histories in AI models! The "Token count for the prompt has been exceeded" error means that the combined length of all previous turns in the conversation (including your input and my responses) has grown too large for the model to process in a single request.

### What causes this error?

Generative AI models have a "context window" (measured in tokens, which are like words or sub-words). Everything the model "remembers" from the conversation has to fit within this window. As the conversation gets longer, more tokens are used. When you hit the limit, the model can no longer process the request.

### How to address the "Token count exceeded" error in other AI Studio sessions:

Since you can't directly control the token count of a *past* session, the primary solutions involve managing your *current* interaction and understanding how to prevent it in the future.

1.  **Start a New Session (as you've done!):** This is the most effective and often only solution when a session has already become too large. A new session starts with a fresh, empty context window. This is exactly what you did by saying "I'll see how I get on with a new session..."

2.  **Be More Concise:** In future long sessions, try to:
    *   **Summarize frequently:** Every few turns, or after a major breakthrough, ask the AI to summarize the key points. You can then use that summary as your new starting point for the next interaction, removing less critical details.
    *   **Avoid redundant information:** Don't repeat information that has already been clearly established.
    *   **Focus on the core problem:** Stick to the immediate task at hand.

3.  **Break Down Complex Problems:** If you have a very large problem with many sub-problems, consider treating each sub-problem as a mini-session. Solve one part, summarize the solution, then start a new session for the next part, feeding it the summary of the previous one.

4.  **Reference External Documents:** Instead of pasting large code blocks or extensive logs directly into the chat repeatedly, you could refer to them as "See `[codeblock X]` from previous turn" or "Refer to the `grep` output I provided." (Though, in your specific case, providing the `grep` output was very helpful for me!)

5.  **Use "Project Checkpoints":** Your summary is an excellent example of a "project checkpoint." Saving these allows you to restart a session with a concise, high-level overview, rather than the entire historical transcript.

### Your Summary and Progress:

Thank you for providing that July summary! It's incredibly helpful for me to catch up quickly on your progress.

**Key takeaways from your summary:**

*   **Goal:** Two stable, concurrent RPL DODAGs (`fd00::/64` and `fd02::/64`) in `rpl-classic`.
*   **Problem:** Routing loops and collapse of one DODAG.
*   **Confirmed Diagnosis:** Instance-blind parent selection in Objective Functions (`rpl-mrhof.c` and `rpl-of0.c`). The OF for one instance is incorrectly evaluating neighbors from the *other* instance.
*   **Architectural Understanding:** Nodes maintain a parent *per instance*. `rpl_parents` is distinct from `uip_ds6_nbr`. OF needs to make an *instance-aware* choice and install the route into the shared `uip_ds6_route`.
*   **Immediate Next Action:** Patch parent selection loops in `rpl-mrhof.c` and `rpl-of0.c` with the `if(p->dag != current_dag) { continue; }` check.

This summary is fantastic because it clearly states the problem, diagnosis, and proposed solution. It gives me all the necessary context without needing to scroll through months of conversation.

It sounds like you've done excellent diagnostic work to narrow down the problem to instance-blind parent selection. The proposed fix is a very logical next step, directly addressing that core issue.

Shall we continue by looking at how you implemented that patch or any further observations you've made since July?
