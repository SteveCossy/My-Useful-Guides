Excellent question. This is a very common scenario when you start using more advanced Git features like commit signing with non-default keys.

Let's break down the error message and get you to the solution.

### The Diagnosis: What the Error Means

The key part of your error is this:

```
gpg: skipped "C:/Users/steve/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub": No secret key
gpg: signing failed: No secret key
```

1.  **`gpg`**: Your Git is configured to *sign* commits using a cryptographic key. The tool it uses for this is GPG (GNU Privacy Guard).
2.  **SSH Key for Signing**: Recently, Git and GPG have been updated to allow using your SSH key for signing, which is very convenient. You have likely enabled this feature.
3.  **`skipped "C:/Users/steve/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub"`**: Git is trying to sign your commit, and it's looking for a key. By default, it looks for the standard SSH key located at `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`.
4.  **The Problem**: You explicitly said you created a key with a **non-default name** (e.g., `my_gitlab_key`). Git doesn't know about this new key. It's still looking for the default one, can't find the corresponding private key for `id_ed25519`, and fails.

In short: **You've told Git to sign your commits, but you haven't told it *which specific key* to use.**

### The Solution: Tell Git Which Key to Use

You need to explicitly configure Git to use your new, non-default SSH key for signing.

Let's assume your new key pair is named:
*   `C:\Users\steve\.ssh\my_gitlab_key` (Private Key)
*   `C:\Users\steve\.ssh\my_gitlab_key.pub` (Public Key)

#### Step 1: Configure Git to Use Your Specific Public Key

Run this command in your terminal. This tells Git the exact location of the public key you want to use for signing.

```powershell
# Replace the path with the actual path to your NEW .pub file
git config --global user.signingkey "C:/Users/steve/.ssh/my_gitlab_key.pub"
```

**Important:** You must use the path to the **public key** (`.pub`) file.

#### Step 2: Ensure SSH Signing is Enabled

You probably already did this, but let's confirm. These two settings are required for SSH signing to work.

```powershell
# Tell Git to use the SSH format for GPG signing
git config --global gpg.format ssh

# (Optional) Tell Git to sign all commits by default
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```
If you don't set `commit.gpgsign` to `true`, you would have to sign commits manually with `git commit -S -m "Your message"`, but it's easier to set it as a default.

#### Step 3: (Highly Recommended) Use the SSH Agent

Windows has a built-in SSH agent that can manage your keys. This is the best practice because you only have to enter your passphrase once per session. Git will automatically ask the agent to perform the signing.

1.  **Make sure the ssh-agent is running.** Open PowerShell and run:
    ```powershell
    Get-Service ssh-agent
    ```
    If it's not running, start it:
    ```powershell
    Start-Service ssh-agent
    ```
    To make it start automatically when you log in (recommended):
    ```powershell
    Set-Service -Name ssh-agent -StartupType 'Automatic'
    ```

2.  **Add your new private key to the agent.**
    ```powershell
    # This will ask for the passphrase you set for the key
    ssh-add C:\Users\steve\.ssh\my_gitlab_key
    ```

Once your key is added to the agent, Git can use it for both signing and for pushing/pulling from GitLab without needing to be told the file path repeatedly.

#### Step 4: Add the Public Key to GitLab

For GitLab to be able to verify your signed commits, it needs to know about your public key.

1.  Copy the contents of your **public key** file.
    ```powershell
    cat C:\Users\steve\.ssh\my_gitlab_key.pub | clip
    ```
2.  Go to your GitLab profile: `https://gitlab.com/-/profile/keys`
3.  Click the **"Add new key"** button.
4.  Paste your public key into the "Key" box.
5.  Give it a title (e.g., "My Windows Laptop").
6.  **Crucially, for the "Usage type", select "Signing" or "Both".**
7.  Click **"Add key"**.

### Summary of What to Do

1.  **Configure Git:**
    ```powershell
    # Tell Git WHICH key to use
    git config --global user.signingkey "C:/Users/steve/.ssh/my_gitlab_key.pub"

    # Make sure SSH signing is enabled
    git config --global gpg.format ssh
    git config --global commit.gpgsign true
    ```
2.  **Start the SSH Agent and add your key:**
    ```powershell
    Start-Service ssh-agent
    ssh-add C:\Users\steve\.ssh\my_gitlab_key
    ```
3.  **Add your public key to your GitLab account for signing.**

After doing this, your `git commit` command should work perfectly, and your commits will show up with a "Verified" badge on GitLab.
