Of course! You are absolutely right to want a simple strategy for this. Controlling newlines is a fundamental part of creating clean, readable output from shell scripts.

The `echo -n` command you were using is the classic, old-school way to do it, but as you've seen, it can sometimes be a bit clunky.

The modern, more flexible, and generally recommended tool for this job is **`printf`**.

### The `printf` Command: Your Best Friend for Formatted Output

The `printf` command is available in almost every modern shell (including Bash). It works very much like the `printf()` function in C, giving you precise control over your output format.

**The key is that `printf` does NOT add a newline by default.** You have to explicitly tell it to.

### The Strategy

Here are the two simple patterns you need.

#### 1. To Print Something **WITHOUT** a Newline:

Simply give `printf` the string you want to print.

```bash
printf "Waiting for process to finish..."
# The cursor will be left right after the '...'
sleep 2
printf " Done."
# The cursor is now after the '.'
```
**Output (on one line):**
`Waiting for process to finish... Done.`

#### 2. To Print Something **WITH** a Newline:

Add the `\n` character sequence to the end of your format string.

```bash
printf "Processing file: %s\n" "$filename"
```
*   `%s`: This is a format specifier that tells `printf` to insert a string argument here.
*   `\n`: This is the explicit newline character.

### Applying this to Your Script

Let's refactor your script to use `printf`. This is the clean, modern way to write it.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

SEARCH=" ."
LOGFILE="/home/stevecos/Cooja/10-RPL-20250923124829.txt"

for i in 5 6 13 14 16 19 21 24; do
  # Print the prompt WITHOUT a newline
  printf "%s in %s: " "$SEARCH" "$i"
  
  # Run the command pipeline. Its output will appear on the same line.
  grep -nC 1 "$SEARCH" "$LOGFILE" | grep "Node:$i " | head -5
  
  # Now, explicitly print a newline to move to the next line for the next iteration.
  printf "\n"
done
```

**Why this is better:**
*   **It's Explicit:** You are in full control. The newline is only printed when you explicitly ask for it with `\n`. There's no ambiguity.
*   **It's More Powerful:** `printf` can handle all sorts of formatting (like `%d` for integers, `%f` for floats, padding, etc.), which makes it a much more versatile tool for creating complex, well-formatted output.
*   **It's More Portable:** The behavior of `echo` (especially with flags like `-n` and `-e`) can sometimes vary slightly between different shells. `printf` is much more standardized and reliable.

**The simple strategy is:** Use `printf` for all your script output. If you want a newline, add `\n`. If you don't, leave it out.
