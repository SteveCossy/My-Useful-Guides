E hoa, you have made a wise and courageous decision. When a complex series of patches becomes confusing and isn't yielding results, the best and often fastest way forward is to "declare bankruptcy" on the changes and start fresh from a known-good state.

This is a very common and powerful `git` workflow. Here is how you can wind your repository back to the state it was in on a specific date.

### The Plan

We will use a two-step process to do this safely:
1.  **Find the last commit** that was made *on or before* that date.
2.  **Create a new branch** at that old commit. This is crucial because it preserves all your current work on your existing branch. You lose nothing. You are simply creating a new, clean slate to work from.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

Open a terminal in the root of your `contiki-ng` project directory.

#### Step 1: Find the Commit Hash from That Date

We will use `git log` with a special option to find the hash of the last commit made on or before the end of the day on August 7th, 2025.

```bash
git log -n 1 --before="2025-08-08" --pretty=format:%h
```

**Breakdown:**
*   `git log`: The command to show commit history.
*   `-n 1`: We only want the *single* most recent commit that matches.
*   `--before="2025-08-08"`: This is the magic. It tells git to only show commits made *before* midnight at the start of August 8th, 2025. This effectively gives you everything up to the end of August 7th.
*   `--pretty=format:%h`: This formats the output to only show the short commit hash (e.g., `a1b2c3d`), which is all we need.

This command will print a single commit hash. **Copy this hash to your clipboard.** Let's pretend the hash it gives you is `a1b2c3d`.

#### Step 2: Create a New Branch from That Old Commit

Now, we will create a new branch, starting from that exact point in history. This gives you a clean workspace without deleting any of your recent work.

```bash
git checkout -b refactor-fresh-start a1b2c3d
```

**Breakdown:**
*   `git checkout -b`: The command to **c**reate a new **b**ranch and immediately switch to it.
*   `refactor-fresh-start`: This is the name of your new branch. You can call it whatever you like (e.g., `hbh-fix-attempt-2`, `clean-slate`).
*   `a1b2c3d`: This is the commit hash you copied from Step 1. You are telling git, "Start this new branch from this exact point in history."

### What You Have Now

*   Your entire working directory has been instantly reverted to the state it was in on August 7th. All the changes we've made since then are gone (from this branch).
*   Your previous work is completely safe. It still exists on your old branch (which was likely called `develop` or `master`). You can switch back to it at any time with `git checkout develop`.
*   You are now on a new, clean branch called `refactor-fresh-start`, ready to re-apply our fixes methodically, one at a time.

This is the perfect way to restart the process. You have a known-good baseline, and you haven't lost any of your previous exploratory work. Ka pai. You're ready to begin again with a clear head.
