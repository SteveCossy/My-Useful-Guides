E hoa, you are pushing the boundaries of shell scripting in a fantastic way. You've correctly identified the next limitation of our simple script: it can only run a single, simple command. It doesn't understand pipelines (`|`) or complex command sequences.

Your idea for a placeholder is brilliant. Let's build a new, much more powerful version of the script that can handle exactly what you're asking for.

### The Problem with the Old Script

The old script took all arguments after the loop limits and treated them as a single command. This breaks down when you have complex shell syntax like pipes or multiple commands. The `eval` command is powerful, but it can be tricky to get the quoting right for these complex cases.

### The New Strategy: A Function-Based Approach

The most robust and flexible way to solve this in Bash is to turn the command you want to run into a **shell function**. We can then pass the name of this function to our loop script, which will call it for each iteration, passing the hex value as a parameter.

This approach is clean, safe, and handles any level of complexity, including pipes, redirects, and multiple commands.

#### Step 1: Create a "Command Library" Script

First, let's create a new file to hold our complex commands. This keeps things organized.

**File: `my_commands.sh`**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This file contains the definitions of complex commands we want to run in a loop.

# Command 1: Extract DIOs for a specific node and save to a file
# Takes one argument: the hex node ID
extract_dios() {
  local hex_id=$1
  local pcap_file="/home/stevecos/contiki-ng/tools/cooja/radiolog-1758669826426.pcap"
  local output_file="/local/scratch/packetlist2.txt"
  
  # Note: This command will overwrite the output file on each run.
  # If you want to append, use '>>' instead of '>'.
  tshark -r "$pcap_file" \
    -Y "icmpv6.type == 155 && icmpv6.code == 0x01 && ipv6.src != fe80::209:9:9:9" \
    -T fields -e frame.number -e ipv6.src -e icmpv6.rpl.dio.instance \
    -E header=y | column -t > "$output_file"

  local output_file="/local/scratch/packetlist2.txt"
  
  # Note: This command will overwrite the output file on each run.
  # If you want to append, use '>>' instead of '>'.
  tshark -r "$pcap_file" \
    -Y "icmpv6.type == 155 && icmpv6.code == 0x01 && ipv6.src != fe80::209:9:9:9" \
    -T fields -e frame.number -e ipv6.src -e icmpv6.rpl.dio.instance \
    -E header=y | column -t > "$output_file"
    
  # This function doesn't actually use the hex_id, it just generates the full file.
  # We'll make a more useful function next.
}

# Command 2: Count packets for a specific node from the pre-generated file
# Takes one argument: the hex node ID
count_packets() {
  local hex_id=$1
  local input_file="/local/scratch/packetlist2.txt"
  
  # Use printf for clean output without a trailing newline
  printf "Node %s: " "$hex_id"
  
  # Search for the node's address pattern.
  # We use the hex_id twice to match your "ae:ae" example.
  grep -c "${hex_id}:${hex_id}" "$input_file"
}
```

#### Step 2: Create the New, More Powerful `hexloop.sh`

This new version of the loop script will take the name of a function as its argument.

**File: `hexloop.sh` (Version 3)**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# A script to loop through a range of numbers in hex, executing a
# user-defined function for each iteration.

# --- Input Validation ---
if [ "$#" -ne 4 ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <start_dec> <end_dec> <command_file> <function_name>"
  echo "Example: $0 1 24 my_commands.sh count_packets"
  exit 1
fi

START_DEC=$1
END_DEC=$2
COMMAND_FILE=$3
FUNCTION_NAME=$4

# Source the command library file to make its functions available
if [ -f "$COMMAND_FILE" ]; then
  source "$COMMAND_FILE"
else
  echo "Error: Command file not found at '$COMMAND_FILE'"
  exit 1
fi

# Check if the requested function actually exists
if ! declare -f "$FUNCTION_NAME" > /dev/null; then
  echo "Error: Function '$FUNCTION_NAME' is not defined in '$COMMAND_FILE'."
  exit 1
fi

echo "--- Running function '$FUNCTION_NAME' for hex range ${START_DEC}-${END_DEC} ---"

# --- The Main Loop ---
for (( i=$START_DEC; i<=$END_DEC; i++ )); do
  
  hex_var=$(printf "%x" "$i")
  
  # --- Execute the user-defined function, passing the hex variable ---
  "$FUNCTION_NAME" "$hex_var"
  
done

echo "--- Loop finished ---"
```

### How to Use the New System

1.  **Save both scripts** (`my_commands.sh` and the new `hexloop.sh`).
2.  **Make them executable:** `chmod +x my_commands.sh hexloop.sh`.
3.  **Run your command:**

    ```bash
    ./hexloop.sh 1 24 my_commands.sh count_packets
    ```

**What it will do:**
1.  The `hexloop.sh` script will be called.
2.  It will `source` the `my_commands.sh` file, which is like an `#include` and makes the `count_packets` function available in its environment.
3.  It will loop from 1 to 24.
4.  In each iteration, it will call the `count_packets` function, passing the current hex value (e.g., "1", "a", "10") as the first argument (`$1`) to that function.
5.  The `count_packets` function will then execute your `printf` and `grep` commands, correctly substituting the hex value.

**The Output will be exactly what you wanted:**
```
--- Running function 'count_packets' for hex range 1-24 ---
Node 1: 28704
Node 2: 11640
...
Node a: 14136
...
--- Loop finished ---
```

This function-based approach is the standard, robust way to handle complex, multi-part commands in shell scripts. It completely avoids the fragile quoting and parsing issues of `eval` and gives you a clean, reusable library of commands that you can expand over time.
  # This function doesn't actually use the hex_id, it just generates the full file.
  # We'll make a more useful function next.
}

# Command 2: Count packets for a specific node from the pre-generated file
# Takes one argument: the hex node ID
count_packets() {
  local hex_id=$1
  local input_file="/local/scratch/packetlist2.txt"
  
  # Use printf for clean output without a trailing newline
  printf "Node %s: " "$hex_id"
  
  # Search for the node's address pattern.
  # We use the hex_id twice to match your "ae:ae" example.
  grep -c "${hex_id}:${hex_id}" "$input_file"
}
```

  echo "Usage: $0 <start_dec> <end_dec> <command_file> <function_name>"
  echo "Example: $0 1 24 my_commands.sh count_packets"
  exit 1
fi

START_DEC=$1
END_DEC=$2
COMMAND_FILE=$3
FUNCTION_NAME=$4

# Source the command library file to make its functions available
if [ -f "$COMMAND_FILE" ]; then
  source "$COMMAND_FILE"
else
  echo "Error: Command file not found at '$COMMAND_FILE'"
  exit 1
fi

# Check if the requested function actually exists
if ! declare -f "$FUNCTION_NAME" > /dev/null; then
  echo "Error: Function '$FUNCTION_NAME' is not defined in '$COMMAND_FILE'."
  exit 1
fi

echo "--- Running function '$FUNCTION_NAME' for hex range ${START_DEC}-${END_DEC} ---"

# --- The Main Loop ---
for (( i=$START_DEC; i<=$END_DEC; i++ )); do
  
  hex_var=$(printf "%x" "$i")
  
  # --- Execute the user-defined function, passing the hex variable ---
  "$FUNCTION_NAME" "$hex_var"
  
done

echo "--- Loop finished ---"
```
