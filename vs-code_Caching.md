### Go to Definition/Declaration Not Always Working

You have correctly identified a common pain point with remote development, but the cause is likely not what you think.

> "Might this be because I'm using vs code over an ssh connection?"

**No, the SSH connection itself is not the problem.** VS Code's remote development architecture is incredibly robust. It runs a small "VS Code Server" on the remote machine, and all the heavy lifting (like code analysis) happens there, directly on the files. The SSH connection is just a thin transport layer for the UI.

> "Might a caching option help?"

**Yes, but the real problem is that the cache is probably incomplete or incorrect.**

The "Go to Definition," "Find All References," etc., features are powered by the **IntelliSense engine**. For this engine to work, it needs to build a complete database (a cache) of all the symbols in your entire project.

This feature fails for one primary reason: **The IntelliSense engine doesn't know where to find all the necessary header files.**

Contiki-NG has a complex and deep directory structure. If you just open a single file like `rpl-dag.c`, the engine might not know that it needs to also look in `/os/net/ipv6/` or `/arch/cpu/` to find the definitions for `uip_ipaddr_t` or other types.

#### The Solution: The `c_cpp_properties.json` File

This is the exact problem the `c_cpp_properties.json` file is designed to solve. We touched on this when discussing preprocessor directives, but its most important job is telling IntelliSense where to look for files.

1.  **Open the configuration:** Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), `C/C++: Edit Configurations (UI)`.
2.  **Focus on the `Include path` setting.** This is the most critical part. It's a list of directories the IntelliSense engine should scan for header files.
3.  **The Fix:** You need to make sure this path is comprehensive. The simplest and most effective way to do this for a project like Contiki-NG is to use the recursive glob pattern: `${workspaceFolder}/**`.

Here is a robust `c_cpp_properties.json` for a Contiki-NG project:

```json
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Contiki-NG",
            "includePath": [
                // THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT LINE:
                // It tells IntelliSense to search recursively in ALL
                // subdirectories of your open project folder.
                "${workspaceFolder}/**"
            ],
            "defines": [
                // Add your project-specific defines here to help the parser
                "RPL_MOP_STORING_NO_MULTICAST"
            ],
            // You should point this to the compiler for your target architecture
            "compilerPath": "/usr/bin/gcc", 
            "cStandard": "c11",
            "intelliSenseMode": "linux-gcc-x64" // Or clang-x64, or an ARM one
        }
    ],
    "version": 4
}
```

**After you create or update this file:**
*   You might see a database icon in the bottom-right status bar as IntelliSense rebuilds its cache based on the new, correct paths.
*   Give it a minute to finish parsing the entire project.
*   Once it's done, "Go to Definition" and other navigation features should become dramatically more reliable and accurate, because the engine now has a complete map of your entire codebase.

**Control where VS Code stores the bulk of the data generated by the C/C++ extension, but you do it by moving the entire *database path*, not the `c_cpp_properties.json` file itself.**

Let's break down the two components and what you can do.

### 1. The `c_cpp_properties.json` File (The Configuration)

*   **Location:** This file *must* reside in a `.vscode` directory at the root of your workspace (the folder you opened in VS Code). So, the path will be `/path/to/your/project/.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json`.
*   **Size:** This file is **tiny**. It's just a small text file containing your configuration. It's only a few kilobytes at most.
*   **Conclusion:** You cannot and do not need to move this file. It is not the source of your disk space problem.

### 2. The IntelliSense Database (The Real Culprit)

This is what's eating your disk space. When the C/C++ extension parses your entire project based on the settings in `c_cpp_properties.json`, it creates a large database file (often an SQLite file with a `.db` extension) and a "browse" file. For a project the size of Contiki-NG, this database can easily be **tens or even hundreds of megabytes**.

By default, VS Code stores this database in a location relative to your workspace, which is likely on your limited disk allocation.

### The Solution: Moving the Database Path

You can tell the C/C++ extension to store this large database file somewhere else, like a temporary directory or another disk with more space.

1.  **Open your User `settings.json` file** in VS Code (Command Palette -> `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`).
2.  Add the following setting. This will apply to *all* your projects.

    ```json
    // In your user settings.json
    "C_Cpp.default.browse.databaseFilename": "/path/to/large/disk/intellisense.db"
    ```

**How to choose a path:**
*   `/tmp/vscode-intellisense/${workspaceFolderBasename}.db`: A great option. This will create a separate database for each project inside the system's temporary directory (`/tmp`), which is often on a larger partition and is cleared on reboot. The `${workspaceFolderBasename}` is a variable that VS Code will automatically replace with the name of your project folder.
*   `/var/tmp/vscode-intellisense/${workspaceFolderBasename}.db`: Similar to `/tmp` but often persists across reboots.
*   `/home/stevecos/some_other_disk/vscode_cache/${workspaceFolderBasename}.db`: If you have another filesystem mounted in your home directory with more space.

**Complete Example for your `settings.json`:**

```json
{
    // ... your other settings ...

    // Tell the C/C++ extension to store all IntelliSense databases in the /tmp directory
    "C_Cpp.default.browse.databaseFilename": "/tmp/vscode-intellisense-db/${workspaceFolderBasename}.db"
}
```

**After you add this setting and restart VS Code:**
*   The C/C++ extension will now create and use its large database files in the new location you specified.
*   The disk usage in your actual project directory will drop significantly.
*   You will still need the small `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json` file in your project directory to tell the extension *how* to build the database, but the database itself will live elsewhere.

This is the standard and correct way to manage the disk space used by the IntelliSense engine.
