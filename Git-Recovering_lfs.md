Of course! This is a very common situation in Git, and it's frustrating until you understand what's happening. Let's break it down.

### The Problem in Plain English

You're in this loop for two main reasons:

1.  **Your local `main` branch is "behind" the remote `main` branch.** While you were working and creating your commit ("Another simulation"), someone else (or you, on another computer) pushed a change to the `main` branch on GitHub. Git is correctly stopping you from overwriting their work.
2.  **Your `git pull` failed because you have *new* unstaged changes.** After your last commit, you must have modified a file or created a new one. The `git pull` command (especially when it tries to `rebase`, as your error message indicates) needs a clean working directory to safely apply the remote changes.

Here's a visual of the situation:

```
Remote (GitHub):  A --- B --- C  <-- (New changes are here)
                       /
Your computer:    A --- B --- D  <-- ("Another simulation" commit)
```

You need to get commit `C` from the remote onto your computer and then put your commit `D` on top of it, so your history looks like this:

```
Your computer (after fixing): A --- B --- C --- D
```

Then you can push successfully.

### The Recommended Solution (Using Rebase)

This is the cleanest way to solve the problem and results in a linear, easy-to-read history.

**Step 1: Stash your unstaged changes**

The error message `You have unstaged changes` is blocking you. You need to temporarily save them away.

```bash
git stash
```
This command takes all your current uncommitted changes and puts them in a "stash," leaving your working directory clean.

**Step 2: Pull the remote changes and rebase your work**

Now that your directory is clean, you can pull. Using the `--rebase` flag is the key here. It will fetch the remote changes, "rewind" your local commit, apply the remote changes, and then "replay" your commit on top.

```bash
git pull --rebase
```

**Step 3: Re-apply your stashed changes**

Now, bring back the changes you stashed in Step 1.

```bash
git stash pop
```
Your uncommitted changes are now back. At this point, you can either `add` and `commit` them, or discard them if they were accidental.

**Step 4: Push your work**

Your local `main` branch now contains the remote changes plus your own commit on top. You are now "ahead" of the remote and can push successfully.

```bash
git push
```

---

### Alternative Solution (Using a Merge)

If you're not comfortable with `rebase` or if it's a shared branch where rewriting history is discouraged, you can use the default merge strategy.

**Step 1: Stash your unstaged changes**

This step is the same. You need a clean directory.

```bash
git stash
```

**Step 2: Pull the remote changes (this will create a merge commit)**

```bash
git pull
```
Because your histories have diverged, Git will create a "merge commit" to tie the two histories together. This may open a text editor asking you for a merge commit message. You can usually just save and close it.

**Step 3: Re-apply your stashed changes**

```bash
git stash pop
```

**Step 4: Push your work**

```bash
git push
```

### Summary and How to Avoid This in the Future

The "loop" happened because of this sequence: `commit` -> `push` (fail) -> `pull` (fail).

The **Golden Rule** to avoid this is to **pull before you push**. An even better habit is to pull before you even start working.

A good workflow is:
1.  Start your day or a new task: `git pull --rebase`
2.  Do your work (edit files).
3.  Add and commit your changes: `git add .` -> `git commit -m "My new feature"`
4.  Push your final work: `git push`

By pulling first, you ensure you're always working on the most up-to-date version of the branch, which dramatically reduces the chances of a `non-fast-forward` error.

Excellent! You've solved the first problem and immediately hit the next common hurdle when working with large datasets in Git: file size limits.

This is a great error message because it tells you *exactly* what's wrong and how to fix it. Let's break it down.

### The Problem in Plain English

1.  **GitHub's Limit:** GitHub (and most Git hosts) has a strict file size limit. Any single file over **100 MB** will be rejected by a standard `git push`.
2.  **The Culprit:** The error message points to the exact file: `10-RPL-20250714095946.txt` is **300.80 MB**.
3.  **Your LFS Setup:** You are already using Git LFS (Large File Storage), which is the correct tool! However, as your `.gitattributes` file shows (`cat .gitattributes`), you've only told LFS to manage `*.pdf` files.
4.  **The Mistake:** The huge `.txt` file was committed to your repository's history as a regular file, not as an LFS pointer. When you push, you're trying to send the full 300 MB file directly to GitHub, which it's rejecting.

The line `Uploading LFS objects: 100% (133/133)` shows that your PDF files are being handled correctly by LFS, but the giant `.txt` file isn't part of that process.

### The Solution: Rewriting History to Use LFS

You can't just tell Git to track `.txt` files now; the bad commit with the huge file is already in your history. You need to go back and "rewrite" your recent history to convert that large file into an LFS pointer *before* you push.

The `git lfs migrate` command is built for exactly this scenario.

**⚠️ Important Warning:** This process will rewrite your Git history. Since you're having trouble pushing, it's safe to assume no one else has your new commits, so this is fine. If you were collaborating with others on this branch, you would need to coordinate with them.

---

Here are the steps to fix this:

**Step 1: Make a backup (just in case)**

This is a good safety habit before rewriting history. Just copy your project folder.

```bash
cp -r data data_backup
```

**Step 2: Tell Git to track `.txt` files with LFS**

First, you need to update the configuration to include text files.

```bash
git lfs track "*.txt"
```
This command will edit your `.gitattributes` file. Now, add this change to Git's staging area.

```bash
git add .gitattributes
```
*(You don't need to commit this yet, the migrate command will handle it.)*

**Step 3: Use `git lfs migrate` to fix the history**

This is the key command. It will go through your commits, find the files that should have been in LFS (based on the new tracking rule), and convert them.

```bash
git lfs migrate import --include="*.txt"
```
You will see some output as it rewrites the commits. It will find the `300.80 MB` file and convert it to a small LFS pointer file.

**Step 4: Push the corrected history**

Because you have rewritten history, the commit IDs (hashes) on your local machine are now different from what you tried to push before. A regular `git push` will be rejected. You need to perform a "force push" to tell GitHub "I know what I'm doing; please accept my version of history."

```bash
git push --force
```

This time, the push should succeed. Instead of sending a 300 MB file, Git will send a tiny text pointer, and the Git LFS client will upload the actual 300 MB file to the LFS storage associated with your repository.

### Summary of Commands

```bash
# Optional but recommended safety step
cp -r data data_backup

# Tell LFS to track all .txt files from now on
git lfs track "*.txt"
git add .gitattributes

# Rewrite history to move existing .txt files into LFS
git lfs migrate import --include="*.txt"

# Force push the corrected history to the remote
git push --force
```

From this point forward, any new `.txt` or `.pdf` files you `git add` will be automatically handled by Git LFS.
