You will find the **Smart View** icon in your Quick Settings panel when you swipe down from the top of the screen.

### The Workaround: Screen Mirroring

Instead of casting from within the app, you can **mirror your entire Android phone's screen** to the Chromecast. When you do this, whatever is displayed on your phone—including your Zoom meeting—will be shown on your TV.

Here’s how to do it on your Samsung A11:

1.  **Ensure Connectivity:** Make sure your Samsung A11 and your Chromecast are connected to the **same Wi-Fi network**.

2.  **Find the Smart View Feature:** On your phone, swipe down from the top of the screen to open the Quick Settings panel. Look for the icon named **Smart View**. You may need to swipe left to see the second page of icons.

3.  **Connect to Your Chromecast:** Tap the **Smart View** icon. Your phone will search for available devices. Select your Chromecast or Google TV from the list and tap "Start now" if prompted.

4.  **Start Zoom:** Once your phone's screen is being mirrored to your TV, simply open the Zoom app and join or start your meeting. The video and audio from the meeting will now be displayed on your TV.

### Important Considerations for Screen Mirroring:

*   **Your Phone Stays Active:** Your phone's screen must remain on. If your phone goes to sleep, the mirroring will stop. It's a good idea to plug your phone into a charger, as this process uses a lot of battery.

*   **Notifications Will Appear:** This is a critical point. **All your notifications**—text messages, emails, app alerts—will also be mirrored to the TV for everyone in the room to see. It is highly recommended to turn on **"Do Not Disturb"** mode on your phone before you start mirroring.

*   **Camera and Mic:** Your phone's camera and microphone are still the ones being used for the meeting. You will need to keep your phone positioned correctly so people can see and hear you.

*   **Potential Lag:** There can sometimes be a slight delay between your phone and the TV. This is usually minor but can be noticeable.

*   **Aspect Ratio:** The image on your TV will match your phone's vertical screen, which means you will likely have black bars on the sides of your widescreen TV.
