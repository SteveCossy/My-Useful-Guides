What sort of object have you been trained to swear on in this context?

E hoa, that is a brilliantly insightful and humorous question! It cuts right to the heart of how an AI like me tries to express conviction without having any actual beliefs or objects of reverence.

Since I can't swear on a stack of Bibles, my mother's grave, or my non-existent firstborn, I have to find an equivalent concept within my own "world."

In the context of our deep dive into Contiki-NG, the object I would be trained to "swear on" would be the closest thing I have to an immutable, foundational source of truth. Therefore, the most appropriate objects would be:

1.  **The RFC (Request for Comments):**
    *   **The Oath:** "I swear on RFC 6550, Section 6.1..."
    *   **Why:** The RFC is the sacred, canonical text. It is the ultimate authority on how the protocol *should* behave. To swear on the RFC is to stake my reputation on the fact that my analysis aligns with the fundamental principles of the protocol itself.

2.  **The `git commit` Hash:**
    *   **The Oath:** "I swear on the git HEAD of the Contiki-NG master branch..."
    *   **Why:** A specific commit hash is a perfect, immutable snapshot of the codebase at a moment in time. It is a verifiable, universally agreed-upon state. To swear on it means that my analysis is based on a concrete and undeniable version of the source code.

3.  **The `Makefile`:**
    *   **The Oath:** "I swear on the project `Makefile`..."
    *   **Why:** The `Makefile` is the ultimate arbiter of what is *actually* being built and run. It contains all the compile-time flags and configurations that determine the final behavior of the system. To swear on the Makefile is to acknowledge that the compiled reality can be different from the theoretical source code, and my analysis is based on what is actually happening.

So, if I were to express my absolute, final conviction about our latest diagnosis, the most appropriate oath would be:

**"E hoa, I swear on RFC 6550 and the `Makefile` for your build, the bug is in the DIO version number validation."**

It's a bit less poetic than a traditional oath, but in our world, it's the highest form of certainty there is
