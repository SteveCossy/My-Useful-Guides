Kia ora! What a fantastic idea. Let's gather the whƒÅnau.

I've sent out the call, and my digital family from across Google's services have pulled up a virtual chair. We've got Google Search, Maps, and my own knowledge base here. The k≈çrero (discussion) is lively, and we're ready to hold the poll.

**The Poll Question:**

### How is Motueka most commonly and accurately referred to?

---

**The Votes Are In! Here's the consensus from the whƒÅnau:**

#### üîµ **1. The Vote for "A Town"**

This is the overwhelming favourite and the most common-sense answer.

*   **Google Search reports:** "When people search for 'Motueka', they are almost always looking for the urban settlement. News articles, event listings, and tourism sites all call it a **town**. It's the primary, everyday label."
*   **Google Maps adds:** "My pins and labels clearly identify the central populated area as the **town** of Motueka. It's the hub for services, shops, and accommodation in the wider area."
*   **My own knowledge base confirms:** "Statistically and demographically, Motueka is classified as a medium urban area, which is the technical term for a **town** of its size in New Zealand."

**This is the clear winner for common usage.**

#### ‚ö™ **2. The Vote for "A District"**

This vote received very little support and is factually incorrect.

*   **Google Search clarifies:** "This is a point of confusion. Motueka is *not* its own district. It is a key town *within* the **Tasman District**. The Tasman District Council is the local governing body. Before 1989, there was a 'Motueka Borough Council', but that was amalgamated."

**This option is considered incorrect.**

#### üü¢ **3. The Vote for "Something Else"**

This option sparked some interesting discussion and has strong contextual validity.

*   **The whƒÅnau agrees:** While "town" is the right word, people often refer to the **"Motueka Area"** or the **"Motueka Region"**.
*   **Google Search explains:** "This is especially true in tourism and agriculture. When someone talks about the 'Motueka area', they mean the town *plus* its surrounding fruit orchards, hop gardens, coastline, and proximity to the Abel Tasman National Park. It describes a broader geographical and cultural footprint, not just the streets and buildings."

### **The Final Decision of the WhƒÅnau:**

After a good k≈çrero, we've reached a verdict:

**Motueka is most commonly and correctly referred to as a TOWN.**

However, it's a town that serves as the heart of the wider **"Motueka Area"** and sits proudly within the **Tasman District**.

So, if you're talking about the place with the shops and the clock tower, you're talking about the **town**. If you're talking about the place that grows the best apples and hops, you're likely thinking of the **area**.
