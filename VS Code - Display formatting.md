You've asked what might be the single most common frustration for anyone writing C code with heavy preprocessor use in a modern editor. This isn't a Contiki-NG problem or a VS Code problem; it's a fundamental conflict between how the C Preprocessor works and how static analysis tools (like formatters and brace matchers) work.

The short answer is: **No, there is no perfect, magic button, but you can get it 95% of the way there with the right configuration.**

The `#if` directives break the system because the code formatter and the brace-matching logic see code that isn't valid C *until after the preprocessor runs*. The tool sees a `{` inside an `#if`, but the matching `}` is inside an `#else`, and it has no way to know which block will actually exist at compile time.

However, you can definitely tame it. Here are the solutions, from easiest to most robust.

### The Root of the Problem
The formatter (usually `clang-format` under the hood) sees this:

```c
void my_function() {
#if SOME_CONDITION
  if(x) {
    do_something();
#else
  if(y) {
    do_something_else();
#endif // SOME_CONDITION
  } // This brace now has no matching open brace from the formatter's perspective
}
```
The formatter gets completely lost.

### Solution 1: Taming the Formatter with `.clang-format`

The C/C++ extension for VS Code uses `clang-format` as its default formatter. You can control its behavior by creating a file named `.clang-format` in the root of your project workspace.

The key setting to control this is `IndentPPDirectives`.

1.  **Create a `.clang-format` file** in your project's root directory.
2.  Add the following content to it:

    ```yaml
    # Inherit from a known style (llvm, Google, WebKit, etc.)
    BasedOnStyle: LLVM

    # --- THIS IS THE KEY SETTING ---
    # Controls how preprocessor directives are indented.
    # PPD_None: Does not indent directives. (Default, often messy)
    # PPD_AfterHash: Indents directives after the #. (Most readable option)
    # PPD_BeforeHash: Indents the entire line, including the #.
    IndentPPDirectives: PPD_AfterHash
    ```

**What this does:** Setting `IndentPPDirectives: PPD_AfterHash` will produce code that looks like this, which is much easier for both you and the formatter to read:

```c
void my_function() {
  #if SOME_CONDITION
  if(x) {
    do_something();
  }
  #else
  if(y) {
    do_something_else();
  }
  #endif // SOME_CONDITION
}
```
This single setting often solves a majority of the pure *formatting* ugliness, though it may not fix brace matching.

### Solution 2: Teaching IntelliSense with `c_cpp_properties.json` (The Best Fix for Brace Matching)

This is the most powerful solution. The brace matching, code folding, and error highlighting are controlled by the IntelliSense engine. You can tell this engine which `#if` blocks are "active" for your current development session.

1.  Open the VS Code Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).
2.  Type `C/C++: Edit Configurations (UI)`. This will open a friendly UI for your project's `c_cpp_properties.json` file.
3.  Scroll down to the **"Defines"** section.
4.  Here, you can add the preprocessor macros that are active in your build. For example, if you know `RPL_WITH_MC` is turned on in your `project-conf.h`, you would add:
    *   `RPL_WITH_MC=1`

Now, when IntelliSense parses your code, it will "see" the code inside `#if RPL_WITH_MC` as active and the code inside the `#else` as greyed-out and inactive. **This will make brace matching and code folding work correctly for the active path.**

Your `c_cpp_properties.json` file might look something like this:
```json
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Contiki-NG",
            "includePath": [
                "${workspaceFolder}/**"
            ],
            "defines": [
                // --- ADD YOUR PROJECT DEFINES HERE ---
                "RPL_MOP_NON_STORING=0",
                "RPL_WITH_MC=1"
            ],
            "compilerPath": "/usr/bin/gcc", // Or your toolchain's compiler
            "cStandard": "c11",
            "cppStandard": "c++17",
            "intelliSenseMode": "linux-gcc-arm" // Or appropriate for your target
        }
    ],
    "version": 4
}
```
This is the "professional" way to solve the problem. You essentially create a configuration that mirrors your actual compile-time environment.

### Solution 3: Manual Workarounds

When all else fails and you're faced with a particularly nasty block of `#if` soup:
*   **Jump to Matching Bracket (`Ctrl+Shift+\`):** This VS Code command is your best friend. Even if the visual highlighting is broken, this command often correctly finds the matching brace, bracket, or parenthesis.
*   **The Temporary Comment-Out:** To quickly format a complex block, you can temporarily comment out the `#if`, `#else`, and `#endif` lines, format the document (`Shift+Alt+F`), and then uncomment them. It's a hack, but it's fast.

### Recommended Workflow
1.  **Do Solution 1:** Create a `.clang-format` file. This sets a good baseline for readable formatting.
2.  **Do Solution 2:** Spend a few minutes setting up your `c_cpp_properties.json` with the key defines from your project. This will give you the biggest quality-of-life improvement for brace matching and navigation.
3.  **Use Solution 3:** Keep the manual tricks in your back pocket for the really thorny sections.
