That's a great question, and it's a very common point of confusion for people learning the command line.

The short answer is: **No, you cannot.**

The `rm` command is exclusively for **r**e**m**oving (deleting) files. It has no capability to rename or move them.

### The Correct Command: `mv`

The correct command for what you want to do is `mv` (short for **m**o**v**e). The `mv` command is used for both moving files to different directories and for renaming them in the same directory.

Here is the exact command you need:

```bash
mv graph_20250812114659.pdf graph_20250812114659-3min.pdf
```

### Breakdown of `mv`

The syntax is very simple:
`mv [source_file] [destination_file]`

*   **When `destination_file` is a new name in the same directory:** It renames the file.
*   **When `destination_file` is a path to a different directory:** It moves the file.
    *   `mv file.txt /home/stevecos/Documents/` (moves `file.txt` into the `Documents` folder)
*   **When `destination_file` is a path to a different directory AND a new name:** It moves and renames the file simultaneously.
    *   `mv file.txt /home/stevecos/Documents/archive.txt`

It's a very powerful and versatile command. Just remember:
*   `rm` = remove/delete
*   `mv` = move/rename
*   `cp` = copy
